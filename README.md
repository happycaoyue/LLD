# LLD

The implementation of CVPR 2023 paper "Physics-Guided ISO-Dependent Sensor Noise Modeling for Extreme Low-Light Photography" [Paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Cao_Physics-Guided_ISO-Dependent_Sensor_Noise_Modeling_for_Extreme_Low-Light_Photography_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf)" and its supplementary materials "[supplementary materials](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/supplemental/Cao_Physics-Guided_ISO-Dependent_Sensor_CVPR_2023_supplemental.pdf)".





## Highlights

* We investigate the noise formation process in extreme low-light scenarios and propose a novel physicsguided noise model. The ISO dependence is taken into consideration in the proposed method..

* We collect a dataset for extreme low-light image denoising. The dataset contains pairwise noisy-clean images ages captured by two cameras (i.e., Sony A7S2 and Nikon D850). We also provide flat-field and bias
frames covering a wide range of ISO settings.

â€¢ While the learning-based nature eliminates the laborintensive parameter hand-calibration process, our proposed method can achieve superior noise modeling accuracy and boost the image denoising performance.

## LLD Dataset

Our proposed LLD dataset includes paired noisy (high ISO/short exposure) and clean (low ISO/long exposure) images, dark frames, and flat-field frames. All the data encompass various ISO settings and multiple brightness levels. For detailed information, please refer to the paper and the supplementary materials.You can also access the dataset through the Baidu Cloud [link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1eLKzjOSDCR4NNLcvbyenEQ?pwd=WAXY)" and its supplementary materials " provided. If the link becomes inactive, please inform me as soon as possible.
